# DATA-TYPES-IN-C-

AIM : To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types)

SOFTWARE USED : VS CODE

Theory : The C++ program demonstrates the basic structure and usage of built-in data types.
         It includes variable declaration, initialization, and output using cout.
         Data types like int, float, double, char, and bool are used to store different kinds of values.
         The sizeof operator helps determine the memory each data type occupies.

Algorithm : 1. Start the program.

            2. Declare variables of different data types (int, float, double, char, bool).

            3. Assign values to each variable.

            4. Print the values and their memory sizes using cout and sizeof().

            5. End the program.
